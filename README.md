### Objective

In this challenge, your task is to retrieve data from an external API and render it like the provided designs. Use Dart and Flutter.

### Brief

Your challenge is to build out this personal time-tracking dashboard. A perfect opportunity to flex your CSS Grid muscles! Your task is to build the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding`, and `margin`. You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized. Fetch data from the following endpoint:

    https://wookie.codesubmit.io/time-tracking

### Expected behavior

Your users should be able to:

-   [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   [ ] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   [ ] Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats
-   [ ] The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week," e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". It should read "Last Month" for monthly, e.g., "Last Month - 19hrs".

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   **Dart** best practices
-   Show us your work through your commit history
-   Completeness: did you complete the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding!
